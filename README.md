## Project Overview
In this project, we tackle the challenge of categorizing brain tumor images, specifically glioma, meningioma, and pituitary, utilizing various neural network architectures. Given the complex and varied nature of brain tumor images, advanced image processing techniques and machine learning methods are essential for precise categorization.

## Data Management with Datalake

In today's data-intensive world, managing and organizing vast amounts of information is crucial, especially in the medical field. The introduction of a **Datalake**, a centralized repository for storing vast amounts of data in its raw format, becomes a pivotal step for impactful research.

### Key Features of Datalake:
- **Centralized Data Storage:** Provides a single access point to all the data, ensuring quick and easy data retrieval, reducing the risk of duplications, inconsistencies, and data loss.
  
- **Scalability & Flexibility:** As the research progresses and more data is accumulated, a Datalake can scale seamlessly. It is designed to adapt and grow with the project's requirements.
  
- **Metadata Integration:** With every new data set or event addition, its associated metadata is incorporated. Such metadata, detailing the data's origin, type, timestamp, etc., ensures proper data localization, understanding, and usage.
  
- **Datamart Creation:** A significant advantage of using a Datalake is the ability to create Datamarts, specific views structured for a particular purpose, such as training a neural network. This allows for tailoring the data according to each study's specific needs, without compromising the original Datalake's integrity.

## Neural Network Architectures Implemented

Several neural network architectures were implemented and tested to determine their efficacy in categorizing brain tumor images. These architectures include:
- Fully Connected Neural Network (`fc`)
- Convolutional Neural Network 1 (`cnn1`)
- Convolutional Neural Network 2 (`cnn2`)
- Convolutional Neural Network 3 (`cnn3`)
- ResNet-18 (`resnet18`)

Our preliminary results indicate that neural networks hold significant potential in accurately identifying and categorizing different types of brain tumors.

## Conclusion & Future Directions
The Datalake infrastructure ensures a robust and flexible foundation for current research while preparing for future advancements. With this groundwork, we can further delve into the potential of neural networks in diagnosing and categorizing brain tumor images.
